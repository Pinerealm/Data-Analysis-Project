# ANALYSIS OF COMPANY XYZ SUPERMARKET DATAÂ¶

Company XYZ owns a supermarket chain across Nigeria. Each major branch, located in 3 cities across the country, recorded sales information for 3 months to help understand sales trends and determine its growth due to the rise in supermarket competition. I will analyze this data set and bring out valuable insights for the company.


# Project Steps

### The following steps were taken in this analysis
1. Loading of the data set after setting the current working directory then combining files from each of the branches into a single data set.

2. Data exploration using different pandas attributes and methods.

3. Dealing with datetime features including converting relevant data columns to the datetime datatype and extracting time info from them.

4. Extracting unique values of the categorical data.

5. Further data exploration using groupby and aggregation functions.

6. Data visualization using different seaborn library plots.

2. Performing analysis on a data set spanning a longer time period

# Standout Section

* Viewing the header rows of the `csv files` prior concatenation.
* Viewing summaries for non-numerical data using the `.describe()` method.
* Preliminary attempts at answering other important questions.
